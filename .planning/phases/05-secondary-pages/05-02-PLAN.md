<objective>
Build the About/Docs narrative page with structured sections explaining OIL, game mechanics, economics, and Motherlode. Ore.supply style: clear headings, education-first.

Purpose: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04.
Output: About page with full narrative content.
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

From spec: ore.supply-inspired structure—intro (OIL as liquid gold), why mining game, how drilling works (grid, tile costs, volatility), economics (10/30/60), Motherlode mechanics, transparency (Explore dashboards), security/fairness notes.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: OIL narrative and why mining</name>
  <files>components/AboutContent.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create AboutContent component. Section 1: "OIL as Liquid Gold" — OIL positions as a store of value, liquid gold thesis. Section 2: "Why a Mining Game" — gameplay reinforces deflation/backing narrative, fun onboarding. Use prose styling: headings (text-xl font-semibold), paragraphs (text-[var(--text-muted)] leading-relaxed).
  </action>
  <verify>About page has intro sections</verify>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Game mechanics</name>
  <files>components/AboutContent.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Section 3: "How Drilling Works" — grid (3×3, 4×4, 5×5), per-tile cost (visible before flip), volatility (spreads costs around average), chance modes (Equivalent vs Varied). Keep concise, link mentally to in-game controls.

  <action>
    Section 4: "Economics: 10/30/60" — every bet allocates: 10% Motherlode pool, 30% OIL Reserve (buybacks), 60% Payout Reserve. Section 5: "Motherlode Jackpot" — rare outcome (≈0.16%), pays from pool, dramatic moment. Section 6: "Transparency" — Explore dashboard shows reserves, rounds, leaderboards.

  <files>app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Replace About placeholder with AboutContent. Use max-w-3xl centered layout, generous padding (py-12 px-6). Add optional "Security & Fairness" subsection (simple, readable). Ensure scrollable, readable typography.
  </action>
  <verify>About page renders full narrative; readable on desktop</verify>
