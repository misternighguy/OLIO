<objective>
Build the Explore transparency dashboard with live counters, recent rounds feed, and leaderboards. All data mocked for MVP.

Purpose: EXPL-01, EXPL-02, EXPL-03.
Output: Explore page with full dashboard layout.
</objective>

<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

From spec: Explore shows Motherlode pool, OIL Reserve, Payout Reserve, lifetime volume, OIL bought/accumulated, protocol revenue. Recent rounds: timestamp, cost, outcome, payout, winner (shortened). Leaderboards: top miners by volume, top net winners, most Motherlodes hit.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Live counters section</name>
  <files>components/ExploreDashboard.tsx, lib/explore-data.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create lib/explore-data.ts with mocked constants/functions: motherlodePool, oilReserve, payoutReserve, lifetimeVolume, lifetimeOILBought, protocolRevenue. Create ExploreDashboard with a "Live Counters" section: grid of stat cards displaying each metric. Use formatLarge or toLocaleString for big numbers. Match dark premium styling (rounded-lg, bg-white/5, border-white/10).
  </action>
  <verify>Explore page renders all live counters with mocked values</verify>
  <done>EXPL-01 satisfied</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Recent rounds feed</name>
  <files>components/ExploreDashboard.tsx, lib/explore-data.ts</files>
  <action>
    Add mocked recent rounds data: array of { timestamp, cost, outcome, payout, winner (shortened wallet e.g. 0x1234...5678) }. Render a scrollable feed: each row shows outcome icon/label, cost, payout, winner, relative time. Use outcomeConfig icons (✗ ◆ ◇ ★) for Dry/Oil/Refinery/Motherlode. Limit to ~20 items.
  </action>
  <verify>Recent rounds feed displays; each row has outcome, cost, payout</verify>
  <done>EXPL-02 satisfied</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Leaderboards</name>
  <files>components/ExploreDashboard.tsx, lib/explore-data.ts</files>
  <action>
    Add mocked leaderboard data: top miners (by volume), top net winners, most Motherlodes. Each: array of { rank, address (shortened), value }. Render three leaderboard sections or tabs: "Top Miners", "Top Winners", "Most Motherlodes". Use numbered list styling.
  </action>
  <verify>All three leaderboards render with mocked entries</verify>
  <done>EXPL-03 satisfied</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Wire Explore page</name>
  <files>app/explore/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Replace Explore placeholder with ExploreDashboard. Use responsive layout: counters on top (grid), rounds feed and leaderboards below (side-by-side on lg, stacked on mobile). Add page title and optional subtitle.
  </action>
  <verify>Explore page shows full dashboard; layout responsive</verify>
  <done>Explore page complete</done>
</task>
